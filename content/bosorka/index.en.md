<blockquote>
The Witch statue by Tibor Bartfay, located under Bratislava Castle, reminds us early modern era of Bratislava. 
The first woman accused of witchcraft in Bratislava was Agatha Toott Borlobaschin, burned alive on a borderline in 1602. She was in her late 20s.

Agatha was a poor orphan growing up with her grandma. Learning medical effects of herbs in her youth.  A young man fell in love with her, and with her extraordinary beauty. They soon got married, but their love didn’t last long, he died.
Women, jealous of her beauty were spreading rumors of her. That she got rid of him, because she can be with the devil and her beauty is the evidence of it, because it’s not her, it’s devil’s beauty.
Her life ended on 24. May 1602.
